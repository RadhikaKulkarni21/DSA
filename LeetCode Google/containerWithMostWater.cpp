/*
You are given an integer array height of length n. 
There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the 
ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, 
such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
