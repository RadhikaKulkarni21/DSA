/*Basically the question is to deep copy the linked list, 
that is make an exact copy.(replicate the random nodes too)
If it was simple single linked list, it was simple.
Just make a copy on the go and connect the nodes.
But if the random element is present we have to replicate it to, 
just imagine you made a new node and the random of this node points
 to a node which is not yet created ?What will you do? 
 How will you Point to that node, thats what we have to solve here*/
