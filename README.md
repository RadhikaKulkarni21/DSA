# Data Structure and Algorithms
 *(In progress)* This repository consists of most of the DSA concepts, basics code files of them and some leetcode level problems. I did a udemy course for DSA in C++ so the concepts practice questions were in local IDE(VS code).

 ## Content
   1) Folders named after DSA concepts consists of basic codes of that concept, some might have practice problems.
   2) "LeetCode" folder has leetcode premium questions that I solved from their Google, microsoft etc questions.
   3) "Others" folder has questions made by chatgpt to practice for interviews.
   4) System Design are questions that help you learn creating a system from sratch.

## Note 
1) There are also questions added that were asked in interviews either live coding or those coding tests.
I haven't differentiated them into *tests* but they are there somewhere. 
2) Few of the codes written do not have a main function so they don't run locally but the code is 100% correct and will require you to create a main function to check(this is because either the code was asked to me in coding tests or interviews)
3) The file *lcHeader.h* is a common header file for a lot of codes within. Some folders might have their own headers because I got the idea of creating a common header much later in the practice.
4) Few comments might seem childish but that was just my way of understanding code.
