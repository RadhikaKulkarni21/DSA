/*
Write a function called longestConsecutiveSequence.

This function takes a list of numbers as input and finds the length 
of the longest sequence of numbers that can be arranged in order.

For example, if the list is [2, 1, 6, 9, 4, 3], 
the longest sequence in order is [1, 2, 3, 4], 
and the length is 4.
